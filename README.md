My solutions to the coding competition Advent of Code for 2022
Found here: adventofcode.com/2022

I want to note that this code is very much written for the context of a coding competition. Solutions are often messy and may not be up to my standards for a production environment, as the goal is to solve the problem quickly. Maybe I'll go back and clean it up eventually, but I somewhat doubt that. 

Shout out to github.com/AxlLind from whom I took the meat of fetch.sh script
